The Biohazard Wiki is a website I made for our community and games, containing information and lore.
If you would like to join the Discord server, you may through this link: https://discord.gg/aQRDkfTVpE

NOTE: Every once in a while the Discord links expire, so if the link is expired from in the site, I'll post the newest one here. Later I will change the link method and make it all in on page that updates automatically.
