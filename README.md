The Biohazard Wiki is a website I made for our community and games, containing information and lore.

Alpha 1.1 Changelog:

The website can now be installed as an app; don't worry, there is no security risk because it's just html code and you can see the code for yourself if you really want to double check, and I don't have any code related to collecting data or none of that. Just simply displaying words.

How to install:

Note: Only works on Chrome or Microsoft Edge

On one of those browsers, go to the website and look in the url bar, at the far right, there should be a box and if you hover over it, it should say "Install app" or "ready to install" or something like that. It does not require Windows UAC permissions, why would it?

The app should update automatically when I change stuff. 

If you have questions, you may leave a comment somewhere on my repo or message me on Discord.

*You don't have to install it as an app, it's just there for convenience.

That's all for Alpha 1.1

For future stuff, I will always have a changelog listed in README.md; or the description of the release page.
